Image-Captioning-Pytorch
=====

- In this repo, I tried to implement code in Pytorch to deal with the task of captioning images. 2 models were used and the main difference is that one uses decoder with just RNN, while the other has added attention mechanism. I would like to thanks the authors of 
[this detailed repo](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning) to help me understand more about the encoder-decoder model for image captioning task. :smile:
